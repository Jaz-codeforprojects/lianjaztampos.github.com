            <h1>The People </h1>
            <p> Seventh-Day Adventists believe all people are created equal in the eyes of God 
                and that we were created equal in God's Image. Because of This, it is vitally 
                important help people understand the Bible to find healinf, hope and freedom 
                in Jesus. Only through personal relationships with Jesus can each 
                of us grow into our full potential as human beings whether we are children,
                women or men.
                <br>Our church is not about having four walls and a pulpit. it is about living in
                harnony as the body of Christ. This means each church member loves, 
                respect and values the other members, realizing that just as different organs 
                make up the body, so different, so different members are needed to form the Church.
                Sure, we'll disagree sometimes, adn from time to time, even the closest family have some friction. 
                That's when Christian love and patience comes in. As Christians we have the privilege to model for the world
                how God calls us to live in a caring, compassionate community. Here's to a
                happy family with Jesus at the center!
